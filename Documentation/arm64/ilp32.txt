=========================

This document describes the ILP32 syscall ABI and where it differs
from the generic linux syscall interface.

Some structures are changed to reduce the difference in the code path
for both ILP32 and LP64 ABIs for signal handling.

The following structures have been changed so the layout of the
structures are the same between ILP32 and LP64 ABIs, including:
 * sigval_t        contains pointers
 * sigevent        Uses sigval_t which causes it to be the same.  Special
                   handing is needed for reading; in the mq_notify syscall
 * sigaction       Conversion is handled in the userland (glibc), as the
		    userland data structures are defined in glibc anyway.

A number of structures differ between ILP32 and LP64, including:
 * timespec        uses time_t and suseconds_t
 * timeval         uses time_t and suseconds_t
 * stat            uses timespec/time_t
 * semid64_ds      uses time_t.
 * msqid64_ds      uses time_t.
 * shmid64_ds      uses time_t.
 * rt_sigframe     uses siginfo and ucontext.
 * siginfo_t       uses clock_t and sigval_t
 * ucontext        uses stack_t and sigset_t
 * fd_set          This is done to avoid endian issues between ILP32 and
		   LP64. Syscalls consuming fd_set use timespec.
 * struct msgbuf   The specification of 'struct msgbuf' defines the 'mtype'
                   field as a 'long' (i.e. 32bit for ILP32, but 64bit for
		   LP64).  Functions that operate on 'struct msgbuf' need
		   to be passed through the compat-syscalls to resolve
		   this.
 * stack_t         contains pointers (handled in the compatibility layer)

Also the syscalls which normally would pass 64bit values as two arguments;
now pass the 64bit value as one argument.  Also they have been renamed
(removing the 64 from the name) to avoid confusion.
The list of these LP64 syscalls reused by ILP32 clients is:
 * fcntl
 * statfs
 * fstatfs
 * truncate
 * ftruncate
 * lseek
 * sendfile
 * newfstatat
 * fstat
 * mmap
 * fadvise64
